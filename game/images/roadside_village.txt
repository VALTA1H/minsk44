charming roadside village nestled next to a dense forest. The scene should feature quaint cottages with flower-filled gardens lining a narrow road. Tall trees from the nearby forest rise in the background, their leaves creating a lush canopy. Sunlight filters through the branches, casting dappled shadows on the cottages. The atmosphere feels warm and welcoming, with a sense of peaceful rural life and the soothing sounds of nature in the air.
