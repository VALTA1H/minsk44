Soviet military camp in a forest during the evening. The scene is illuminated by warm, fading sunlight filtering through the trees, casting long shadows on the ground. Tents are pitched amidst the dense foliage, with soldiers' equipment scattered around. A campfire burns quietly at the center, with smoke drifting lazily into the air. The atmosphere should feel calm and contemplative, hinting at the stories of camaraderie and resilience shared around the fire.
