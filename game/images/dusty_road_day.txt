dusty road on a summer morning, bathed in the warm light of the rising sun. The road should be surrounded by lush green fields and wildflowers swaying gently in the breeze. Dust particles dance in the light, creating a hazy glow. The sky is clear with a few fluffy clouds, and the atmosphere feels fresh and inviting, as small birds dart overhead and the sounds of nature come alive.
