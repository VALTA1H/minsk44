ruins of Babruysk during World War II. The scene should depict devastated buildings with crumbled walls and shattered windows, reflecting the impact of conflict. Smoke rises from the debris, and the ground is littered with remnants of wartime life. The atmosphere is somber, with dark clouds overhead, and faint outlines of trees and distant structures hinting at the past. The overall mood should evoke a sense of loss and resilience in the face of destruction.
