serene river bank at night, illuminated by the soft glow of a full moon. The river should reflect the moonlight, creating a shimmering path across the water. Lush trees line the bank, casting gentle shadows, while soft grasses sway in a light breeze. The sky is deep blue with a scattering of stars. The atmosphere should be tranquil and calming, evoking a sense of peaceful solitude.
