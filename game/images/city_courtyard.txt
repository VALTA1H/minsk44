ruins of Babruysk during World War II, showcasing half of the scene as devastated buildings with crumbled walls and shattered windows, and the other half featuring an intact home at the end of the street. The intact house stands resilient amidst the destruction, with smoke gently rising from the rubble. The atmosphere should feel poignant, contrasting the desolation of war with the perseverance of life. Dark clouds loom overhead, while the calmness of the intact home hints at hope and survival.
