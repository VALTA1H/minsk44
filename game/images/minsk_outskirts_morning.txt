charming roadside village on the outskirts of a 20th-century city. The scene should feature quaint cottages with flower-filled gardens lining a narrow road. A rustic wooden bridge arches gracefully over a nearby swamp, surrounded by tall reeds and water lilies. Wisps of smoke gently rise above the bridge, hinting at a cozy fire nearby. In the background, the distant outlines of urban buildings and factories are visible, blending with the lush greenery. Sunlight filters through the branches of nearby trees, casting dappled shadows on the cottages and the bridge. The atmosphere feels warm and welcoming, with a sense of peaceful rural life juxtaposed against the bustling energy of the city
