city street in ruins during the day. The scene should depict crumbled buildings, shattered windows, and debris strewn across the pavement under a bright blue sky. Sunlight casts stark shadows, highlighting the remnants of what once was. Parts of the street are cracked and overgrown with weeds, while scattered remnants of daily life hint at the past. The overall atmosphere should convey a sense of loss juxtaposed with the resilience of nature reclaiming the space.
