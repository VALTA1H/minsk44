quaint village at dawn, bathed in the soft, warm light of the rising sun. The village should feature charming cottages with thatched roofs and colorful flower gardens. Gentle mist hovers over the ground, while birds chirp in the trees. The sky is painted with soft pinks and oranges, hinting at the new day. The atmosphere should feel peaceful and inviting, with villagers beginning their morning routines.
